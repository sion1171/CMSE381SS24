On average, 50% of MSU graduates has an average GPA of A, 40% has a B and 10% has a C or below. Based on some investigation, we found for those obtaining A, the average SAT score is 1250, for those  obtaining B, the average SAT score is 1050,  for those  obtaining GPA less than B, the average SAT score is 800. The standard deviation of the SAT score among all MSU students is 200. Based on this information, help a student whose SAT score = 1100 to predict his/her future average GPA."
